In this project we used Django to create a site which can track squirrels in Central Park. Each squirrel is assigned with unique ID and their features are recorded in the dataset. The app also allows you to update the sighting/give new sighting with given features. The general stats presented, based on data.
Besides of the required content, several tests are performed to ensure that the site can function properly.
Any furthur suggestion is greatly welcomed!
